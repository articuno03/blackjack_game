# UPDATES

So as of right now the chat feature works and the list feature works. 

- I tried to implement an error case if a user enters a duplicate username but i cant get
it to work properly. Gonna save this for another time

- The quit feature doesnt work as expected for "go back". Rather then leaving the chat it immediately disconnects the client. So theres no way to leave chat mode.

Going forward...
- The start feature needs to act as a queue so that the game starts only when all players type "start". As soon as this is implemented, we can start doing the game.

Side note
- Im gonna work on this a lot during break
- Be super careful about what gets merged I had some close calls
